# Data Viz Programming Exercise

## Files:

session_history.csv 	- Build history for a project over the course of several months, includes overall build times and status

Problems:

## 1. Charting app

Implement JS app that reads the session_history.csv file, and uses a JS charting library of your choice to present the following time-series:

   - passing and failing builds per day, stacked-chart
   - build duration vs. time

## 2. Highlight Outliers

Extend the app from (1) to annotate days in the chart that have an "abnormal" number of failing builds.  Define (and justify) how you are determining "abnormal".

The input file is CSV formatted with one line per build ("session").  For example:

~~~
"session_id","started_by","created_at","summary_status","duration","worker_time","bundle_time","num_workers","branch","commit_id","started_tests_count","passed_tests_count","failed_tests_count","pending_tests_count","skipped_tests_count","error_tests_count"

~~~

The interesting columns are:

    (3) - Build created_at
    (4) - Build final status
    (5) - Build overall duration, in seconds
